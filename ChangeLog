	* Version 1.5 released.

	* Protocol: Fix race condition in collision detection.

	  The protocol was slightly extended such that the SPI slave is now
	  expected to send a zero byte when it is ready to receive data from
	  the master, and a NOP when it's not. Anything else is considered
	  protocol data, indicating a collision, and is fed into the SPI input
	  buffer.

	  Collisions like these are bound to happen sometimes because it is
	  simply impossible for the slave to tell that a master transaction is
	  about to begin. For the master it is equally impossible to check the
	  request line and start a master SPI transaction at exactly the same
	  time, so for a small time window there is a chance for a collision
	  to happen.

	* Protocol: Request GPIO is checked before starting to poll the slave
	  device. This reduces the amount of unnecessary polling during a
	  collision.

	* Testing: Add command line option to enable dummy mode for testing on
	  PCs (no SPI nor GPIO accesses are being made in this mode). Pass a
	  dash to the --spidev option to enable dummy mode.

	* Version 1.4 released.

	* SPI interface: Increased clock frequency from 128 kHz to 1 MHz,
	  resulting in a speed-up of transfers by a factor of more than 7.8.

	* SPI transactions: Slave poll interval reduced from 30 ms to 5 ms,
	  resulting in vastly improved latencies.

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* Slave transactions: Better input sanitation, do not accept
	  transaction sizes bigger than 256.

	* Version 1.2 released.

	* Show version information in log, add --version option.

	* Fix SPI collision and repeated requests handling.

2015-06-30  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.1 released.

	* Reduce SPI traffic while waiting for slave.

2015-06-11  Robert Tiemann  <r.tiemann@ta-hifi.de>

	* Version 1.0 released.

	* First release for testing.
