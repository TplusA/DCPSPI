Description: DCP over SPI transport daemon
 A daemon that implements DCP over SPI as an SPI master. This is basically a
 low-level protocol driver implemented in userspace.
 .
 Note that this daemon is only a temporary solution with a lot of problems due
 to its nature as a userspace program. For more robustness and efficiency, it
 should really be replaced by a kernel driver.
